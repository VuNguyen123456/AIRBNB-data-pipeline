# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

# The stuff that will be put into snowflakes will be under the database and schema
# defined in the profile used by this project.
# The tables and stuff that ran sql in models/ will be created under that database and schema.
